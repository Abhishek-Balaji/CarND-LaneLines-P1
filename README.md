I have uploaded my work as part of the Udacity Self Driving Engineer Nanodegree's projects "Finding Lane Lines on the Road". I have chosen to use the suggested Canny Edge Detection and Hough Transform line detection. As I have not enrolled myself, I haven't written the writeup.
P1.ipynb is the file with my solution.
